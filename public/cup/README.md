# About the "cup poem"

in 2013, I got this cup for my birthday:

from a Taiwan company called Mr. Sai 賽先生

I think this is my cup, in "running style" script, though it has been updated with some of the more recently discovered elements and a slightly different design:

There's also a Seal script version of the cup:

this looks like a knock-off

nice-looking in a more traditional cup, with some nice non-Chinese table of the elements variations

## Beagle Talk

This is where I prepare my Beagle talk on the Chinese Periodic Table.

As a near-lifelong student of Chinese, some time ago I decided to switch from cursing Chinese characters to praising them.

I went through 3 overlapping phases:

1. Woah, Chinese characters, so cool-looking
2. This has got to be the dumbest writing system
3. Maybe this is better than the alphabet

If you read between the lines, a lot of this is WHY CAN'T I LEARN THIS?!

## Miscellaneous

This looks worth reading:

It helped me make this low-res generated calligraphy:
